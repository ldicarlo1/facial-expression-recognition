# MNIST Facial Expression Recognition
##### Author: Luca Di Carlo


This project's main aim was to be able to identify and classify hand-written numbers from 0 to 9 of the MNIST dataset. 
A total of 70,000 images were used, with a training/testing split of 60000/10000 images.

Ultimately two simple machine learning algorithms were implemented in order to classify the hand-written digits, being 
K-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest.

Dimensionality reduction was applied first which resulted in a feature reduction of nearly 98%.
